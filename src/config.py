# set to a unique device name otherwise the id will be used.
# This is relevant for homeassistant mqtt autodiscovery so the device gets

# It is also used with the unix port instead of the unique chip id (which is not available
# on the unix port) and it therefore has to be UNIQUE in your network or
# it will result in problems.
